Exercise - Within your repo you must have the following: 

- Dev branch
- 3x feature branches each with a file specific to that feature (feature_branch_1 -> feature_1.txt)
- Within each feature branch push up your code to github 

git branch -> outputs all branches

git checkout <branch name> -> use that branch

git checkout -b <branch name> -> Create AND use that branch

git branch -d <branch name> -> Delete this branch (locally)
